## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Min build time | 151s |
| Max build time | 221.5s |
| Avg build time | 188.8s |
| **Drift (iter 1 vs 10)** | **+22.7s (11.5%)** |
| **Throttle ratio (max/min)** | **1.12x** |
| **Max temp** | **~70°C** |

## Conclusion

Minimal throttling throughout — build times stayed in the 151–221s range with no severe spikes. Throttle ratio of 1.12x indicates excellent thermal stability. CPU ran at ~70°C max, leaving significant thermal headroom even under sustained load.
